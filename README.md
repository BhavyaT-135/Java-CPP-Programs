# Java Programs - Data Structures and Algorithmsâœ¨
This repository contains codes for various Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, along with LeetCode Problems!

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem.

Data structures and algorithms (DSA) goes through solutions to standard problems in detail and gives you an insight into how efficient it is to use each one of them. It also teaches you the science of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. This enables you to choose the best of various choices.
